# LLM Pulse — End-to-End Observability for Production LLM Applications

LLM Pulse is a production-style backend system that demonstrates how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** should be **monitored, measured, and operated** in real-world environments.

Instead of focusing on chatbot outputs, this project focuses on **observability** — tracking latency, usage, cost signals, safety risks, and reliability for LLM-powered applications.

This project was built as part of the **AI Partner Catalyst: Accelerate Innovation** hackathon.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Most LLM demos treat the model as a black box:
- No visibility into latency
- No understanding of token usage or cost signals
- No monitoring of prompt safety or abuse
- No alerting when things go wrong

In production systems, this lack of observability leads to:
- Unpredictable costs
- Poor user experience
- Safety and governance risks
- Difficult incident response

---

## 💡 Solution

LLM Pulse treats the LLM as a **production dependency**, not a demo feature.

The system instruments key metrics around every LLM request, enabling teams to:
- Monitor performance and latency
- Track token usage as a cost proxy
- Detect abnormal or risky prompts
- Measure reliability and error rates
- Build dashboards and alerts for real-world operations

The architecture is **vendor-agnostic** and can be extended to any LLM provider.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

- **FastAPI** backend exposes an `/infer` endpoint
- **LLM service abstraction** decouples the model from application logic
- **Mock LLM client** enables fully free, local development
- **Observability layer** emits production-style metrics
- Metrics are structured to be compatible with **Datadog-style dashboards**

Client → FastAPI → LLM Service → Metrics Emitter → Dashboards / Alerts

## 📊 Observability Metrics

LLM Pulse tracks the following **core production metrics**:

| Category | Metric Name | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Traffic | `llm.requests.count` | Request volume |
| Performance | `llm.request.latency_ms` | Response time |
| Usage | `llm.tokens.used` | Cost proxy |
| Safety | `llm.prompt.length` | Prompt risk signal |
| Reliability | `llm.request.error_rate` | Failure detection |

These metrics align with industry best practices for operating LLM systems.

## 📈 Observability Dashboards

### 1️⃣ LLM Performance Overview
- Request latency (p50 / p95)
- Request count

**Insight:** Detects performance degradation and user experience issues.

---

### 2️⃣ Usage & Cost Signals
- Tokens used per request
- Token usage trends over time

**Insight:** Tracks cost efficiency without relying on provider-specific billing.

---

### 3️⃣ Safety & Prompt Risk
- Prompt length distribution
- Spike detection for unusually long prompts

**Insight:** Identifies potential misuse, jailbreak attempts, or policy risk.

---

### 4️⃣ Reliability & Errors
- Error rate over time
- Incident correlation

**Insight:** Enables rapid response to LLM failures.

---

## 🚨 Alerts & Incident Detection

Example production alerts:

- **High Latency Alert**
  - Trigger: p95 latency > 2000ms
  - Action: Investigate model or infrastructure issues

- **Token Spike Alert**
  - Trigger: Sudden increase in token usage
  - Action: Detect inefficient prompts or abuse

- **Error Rate Alert**
  - Trigger: Error rate > 5%
  - Action: Failover or traffic throttling

---

## 🧠 Why Observability Matters for LLMs

LLMs behave differently from traditional services.  
Latency, cost, and safety risks are often hidden inside prompts and responses.

LLM Pulse demonstrates how treating LLMs as **observable production services** enables:
- Safer deployments
- Predictable performance
- Cost awareness
- Faster incident response
- Better governance and accountability
